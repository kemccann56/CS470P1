## Running the program
Inside the `Project1` folder, you should see the `Java_Animation` and `windows-amd64` folders.
`Java_Animation` contains the Processing source code.
On Windows, open the `windows-amd64` folder and run the `Java_Animation.exe` application file to start the program.

## Using the program
This program generates a randomized array, then runs the user's chosen algorithm to select the top-K integers.
A window should open after running `Java_Animation.exe`. Follow the onscreen instructions:
- "Click in this window to start typing"
- "First, type in K between 1 and 27, then press enter."
- "Next, press M for Merge Sort then press enter."
- "Or, press Q for Quick Select then press enter."
- Do not use the backspace key while typing in the program window.
- Array size can be customized by editing the window size on line 46, but then .exe must be recompiled.

Closing the program and running it again will give you a new randomized array.
